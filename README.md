# autogen_LC_PML
auto-generating locally-conformal Perfectly Matched Layer

run helmholtz_with_pml.py 
it contains all the setting for the simulation of helmholtz equation with a monopole source in the specified location

all the algorithms and the implementation of the Locally-Conformal PML are in autogen_PML.py
